 <br> Narcissus the pretty flower with yellow and white color,
 <br> ecounter in park like the joyful and chastity person, that can be
 <br> vain in times without beautiful meaning, 
 <br> even the sky sometime sad,
 <br> rain will overcome to make beatiful rainbow,
 <br> Going deep down to heart,
 <br> overthingking by looking at ur own work,
 <br> never look good at your sight,
 <br> no one have the same thought as u,
 <br> after all it's u pressing urself harder,
 <br> Giving up after stressing, make 
 <br> irrasional meaning and tought about the
 <br> venue of urself as sinking in feeling, that
 <br> eating all ur motivation to life,
 <br> Yet you dont wanna end up like this,
 <br> our ending is the ending we searched for,
 <br> u shouldnt really be worrying about the past heavily
 <br> Unable to forget it with a lot of
 <br> pressure that might end u alone.

now now u reading it all without knowing u get rickrolled, thanks to me.
